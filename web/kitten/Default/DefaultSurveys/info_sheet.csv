<h3>Name of Lead Investigator:  Dr Indu Dubey (De Montfort University) </h3>

<h4>Invitation paragraph</h4>
You have been invited to take part in a research study.  Before you decide whether to take part it is important for you to understand why the research is being done and what it will involve.  Please take time to read the following information carefully and discuss it with friends and relatives if you wish to. Ask us if there is anything that is not clear or if you would like more information. Take time to decide whether you wish to take part or not.  Thank you for reading this.<br><br>

<h4>What is the study about?</h4>
Worry is a commonly reported difficulty in several mental health conditions. A large number of people who are diagnosed with autism also report having significant worry interfering with their day to day life. In this study we aim to explore various ways through which different events or situations may affect the experience of worry in adults with and without autism or other mental health conditions.<br><br>

<h4>What does the study involve?</h4>
If you decide to participate you will be asked to complete three questionnaires. These questionnaires would have items related to your day to day preferences and behaviours. You would be expected to give a response to all the items presented. After completing these questionnaires you will be shown a 'Choose a box' game. In this game you will see two boxes on the screen with different numbers of locks on them. You will be asked to choose any one of the boxes to look at the linked images or 3 second videos. To open any box, you would need to press the keys as many times as the locks on the chosen box. There is no right or wrong way of choosing the boxes and there is no score for choosing any one box. You are free to choose any box and look at the images/videos you like. Once the game is over, you will be directed to the debrief page, that will tell you a little more about the study and would provide you the information about the researcher if you would like to know more about the project. <br><br>

<h4>Why have I been chosen?</h4>
Any adult above 18 years of age can participate in the study. As the nature of the project we are more interested in involving adults who have received a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders or anxiety disorders (irrespective of co-occurring conditions).  <br><br>

<h4>Do I have to take part?</h4>
It is up to you to decide whether or not to take part.  If you do decide to take part you will be given this information sheet to keep and be asked to sign a consent form.  If you decide to take part you are still free to withdraw at any time during the data collection without giving a reason.<br><br>

<h4>I am interested in taking part, what do I do next?</h4>
Please find a quiet room with minimal distractions. Please ensure you have a good internet connection on a PC / laptop / tablet device. Please do not run the study on a mobile phone.

<h4>What if I agree to take part and then change my mind?</h4>
If you withdraw from the study before completing the tasks, you will be able to do this by clicking on the 'Exit' button and you will be taken to the debrief screen. If you do so your data will be deleted from the server. You can also withdraw from the study within the next three days from the day of participation, without giving a reason. If you decide to withdraw you would need to provide your participation ID to the researchers. Researcher will then delete all the data generated by that ID from their computers. Your ID will be a unique code that can be found top on the debrief form. <br><br>

<h4>What is the procedure that is being tested?</h4>
You will be asked to participate in the study using your private computer/laptop/tablet device but NOT mobile phones.<br><br>

<h4>What are the possible disadvantages and risks of taking part?</h4>
The participation in this study can be tiring as it may take up to 1 hour of responding to various questions and game on computer. Therefore, it is suggested that you take part only when you are feeling ready to spend one hour on computer. Also, for some people making choices, looking at randomly chosen video clips of natural scenes or any ambiguity can be difficult to deal with. If you think you may feel distressed by these then we advise you not to participate in the study.  <br><br>

<h4>What are the possible benefits of taking part? </h4>
There is no direct benefit to the participants however your participation will help us understanding the nature of worry in autism. This can then help in developing suitable interventions for the same. <br><br>
