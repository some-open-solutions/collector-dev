Each time you select a card, the computer will tell you that you won some money. I don't know how much money you will win.

Every so often, when you click on a card, the computer will tell you that you won some money as usual, but then it will say that you lost some money as well. I don't know when you will lose or how much. You will find out as we go along. Every time you lose, the green bar gets smaller.",off,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The goal of the game is to win as much money as possible and avoid losing as much money as possible. You won't know when the game will end. Simply keep on playing until the computer stops.<br><br>I am going to give you £2000 of credit, the green bar, to start the game. The red bar is a reminder of how much money you borrowed to play the game and how much money you have to pay back before we see whether you won or lost.",off,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0,instruct,user,"The only hint I can give you, and the most important thing to note is this: Out of these four decks of cards, there are some that are worse than others, and to win you should try to stay away from bad decks. <br><br>No matter how much you find yourself losing, you can still win the game if you avoid the worst decks. Also note that the computer does not change the order of the cards once the game begins. It does not make you lose at random, or make you lose money based on the last card you picked.",off,,,,,,,,,,,,,
